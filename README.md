The project is an application developed for both students and teachers. The application allows students to select courses by completing a timed multiple-choice quiz (MCQ). Based on the quiz results, students can choose their courses. The teacher can view a list of students who have attempted the quiz. The project utilizes advanced Java features like inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, and involves constructing a GUI with JFrame and other Java packages.
